## Background

I was given 2 static restaurant webpages that completely lacked responsive design and failed to meet accessibility standards. My task was to ensure that the webpages looked good on a variety of screen sizes, and that they were accessible to screen readers and non-impaired individuals alike. I was also tasked with implementing an "offline first" methodology, caching files and assets incase of poor web connectivity.

This was an opportunity to demonstrate what I learned in responsive design, accessibility, and service workers. I primarily worked in the `css/styles.css`, `js/main.js`, and `service_worker.js` files.

This repository is based off of the starter code provided to _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
