## Background

I was given 2 static restaurant webpages that completely lacked responsive design and failed to meet accessibility standards. My task was to ensure that the webpages looked good on a variety of screen sizes, and that they were accessible to screen readers and non-impaired individuals alike. I was also tasked with implementing an "offline first" methodology, caching files and assets incase of poor web connectivity.

This was an opportunity to demonstrate what I learned in responsive design, accessibility, and service workers. I primarily worked in the `css/styles.css`, `js/main.js`, and `service_worker.js` files.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository

2. `cd` into the root directory

3. If you have not already, [install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest version of Python

4. Check your version of Python using `python -V`. It should be `Python 3.x`

5. Start local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

6. Visit http://localhost:8000

## Contributing

This repository is based off of the starter code provided to _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
